# SockX
Our goal for this project was to build a clone of a popular shoe marketplace app like StockX. Our version is called SockX (Selling Only Cool Kicks). We implemeneted the ability to post shoes with photos and other characteristics, as well as the ability to leave reviews and bid for shoes to allow for buying and selling on the platform.

# Getting Started
Click [here](https://sockx-e69f458351d2.herokuapp.com/) to view our app. From there you are free to browse different shoes, leave reviews for shoes you like (or don't like), and bid on shoes you might want to purchase. Also feel free to post your own shoes!

# Next Steps
- Add a timer for the bids so that bidders have a time limit
- Changing our rating feature from numbers to stars that will display on the page
- Display a notification when the owner of a shoe closes a sale
- Shoe accessories, socks, laces, etc.
